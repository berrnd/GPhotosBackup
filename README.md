Backup your Google+ photos (formerly Picasa Web Albums) automatically with this little command line tool.
Note: Currently it also works if you haven't yet upgraded to Google+ and still use the "old" Picasa Web Albums.

Just call it like this:
	`GPhotosBackup.exe username=you@gmail.com password=1234 Destination=C:\Backup\MyGPhotos`

######Disclaimer
This app collects absolutely anonymous usage statistics.
When I develop something for everyone, I want to know a little bit about how often it is used.

So I collect only one summarized number: How often the application is opened (I call it "Heartbeat").

You can ensure yourself about this by looking at the [responsible source code for this action](https://github.com/berrnd/GPhotosBackup/tree/master/GPhotosBackup/Analytics).
If you don't agree with that, simply don't use this application.
